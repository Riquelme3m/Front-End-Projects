        <h1>Graded Readers</h1>
        <p>Graded Readers is a technique where you progress from books at the lowest level (A1) to more difficult books (B2/C1, etc.). The objective is to advance step by step and improve gradually. One key aspect of learning any language is receiving <strong>COMPREHENSIBLE INPUT</strong>. For example, if you are watching a series or reading a book and cannot understand at least 60% of the content, you are not benefiting from it. This technique helps you level up gradually, so there are no surprises.</p>
