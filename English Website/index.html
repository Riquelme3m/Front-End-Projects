            <h1>Start with Your Why</h1>
            <p>
                To begin with, everyone knows that English is important nowadays. However, if you aim to become advanced in this language and speak easily, you must have a strong <strong>WHY</strong>. Because once you start this language learning journey, I guarantee you, it's not going to be easy whatsoever, and you will spend an enormous amount of time on it , but at the end of the day it is worthwhile. Like any other skill in life, you have to practice to master it. So before everything, be aware of your WHY and remind yourself as frequently as possible of your true motivation to learn this language. Therefore, set your goals clearly.

            <div class="why">
            <h1>Don't Opt for Shortcuts</h1>
            <p>
                On the internet, there are many people who say that you can become fluent in English in 6 months, 5 months, and so on. Personally, I think that it's not possible unless you study English 8 hours a day for 6 months straight. But let's be honest: nobody has this much free time to study English daily. Moreover, you will always come across <q>Revolutionary Techniques</q> to learn a language, which are often just clickbait. So once you have set your plan, stick to it unless you feel that you are studying inefficiently. That's why I created this roadmap so that you can avoid feeling lost.

            <h1>What Should You Know to Be Considered Advanced in English?</h1>
            <p>
                Below is the European framework reference, which categorizes levels:
                <table class="cefr-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th colspan="2">Common European Framework</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>A1</td>
                        <td>Beginner</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>A2</td>
                        <td>Elementary</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>B1</td>
                        <td>Intermediate</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>B2</td>
                        <td>Upper Intermediate</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>C1</td>
                        <td>Advanced</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>C2</td>
                        <td>Expert</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <br>
                The key is, if you are at a B2 level, you are very independent while using the language. So no matter what your goal is, if you have this level, you will be fit for almost any opportunity that comes your way, and you will use the language properly. This level is usually desired by everyone, and that's my purpose here: to offer resources and tips for you to reach this level by studying accurately. But before that, we need to understand the following: English is not only about speaking. English involves reading, listening, writing, and, obviously, speaking. So, the best way, in my humble opinion, is to develop these four skills. Of course, you should focus more on the skill you need the most, but don't forget that they work hand in hand.

            <div class="why">
            <h1>Don't Be a Perfectionist and Speak from Day One</h1>
            <p>
                Regardless of your personality, speaking from day one is key when it comes to language learning. So <strong>AS SOON AS</strong> you learn a new expression, idiom, or linking word, write it down and use it. Otherwise, you will forget it in a matter of hours. Another important point is: <strong style="color:red;">MAKE MISTAKES</strong>. Without making mistakes, you won't evolve.

            <br>
            <div class="why">
            <h1>Let's Get Started</h1>
            <p>
                Ok, you already know your why and what learning a language involves. So, let's take the first steps. I will mention things that will NOT make you good at English, but are mandatory to give you the initial push:
                <ul class="duties">
                    <li>Change the language of your cellphone to English</li>
                    <li>Change the language of your computer to English</li>
                    <li>If you are a beginner, try to use Duolingo daily</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                With these done, I will guide you in each section on how to improve each skill, including Reading, Listening, Speaking, Writing, Grammar, and Vocabulary. So go to the sections and find the resources tailored to your level.
            </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="why">
            <h1>Outcomes</h1>
            <p>
                I believe that by following these steps in each section, you can reach a B2 level in the language. Afterward, you just need to consume and use the language regularly. Once you know all the structures, you will only need to practice more and more and enjoy the fruits of your studies. Being able to do whatever you want in English, like learning programming, watching series, speaking to foreigners, and writing texts, are the most rewarding things ever, in my point of view.
